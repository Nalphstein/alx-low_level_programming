#More on Single Linked Lists

This time instead of strings, the linked list contains integers. As before, function protoypes are given, the node struct as well and are found in the header file. The scripts answer the following questions:
0. Write a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list and return the number of elements in the list.

Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list.
Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list. It should return the address o the new element.
Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list. It should return the address o the new element.
Write a function that free a listint_t list.
Write a function that free a listint_t list and set the head element to NULL.
The following questions return an address on success and NULL on failure.
Write a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head node's data (n).
Write a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.
Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.
Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.
Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list. It should return 1 on success and -1 on failure.
Write a function that reverses a listint_t linked list with the following limitations: You are not allowed to use more than 1 loop. You are not allowed to use malloc, free or array. You can only declare a maximum of two variables in your function.
Write a function that prints a listint_t linked list and returns the number of nodes in the list. This function can print lists with a loop. You should go though the list only once. If the function fails, exit the program with status 98.
Write a function that free a listint_t list. This function can free lists with a loop. You should go though the list only once. The function sets the head to NULL.
Write a function that finds the loop in a linked list. It returns the address of the node where the loop starts, or NULL if there is no loop. You are not allowed to use malloc, free or arrays. You can only declare a maximum of two variables in your function.
