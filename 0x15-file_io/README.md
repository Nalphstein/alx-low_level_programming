iThis folder contains our first approach to file I/O in general and in C in particular. We are only allowed to use the system calls read, write, open and close. We also have to use POSIX standards. This link is a presentation I made. We had to answer the following questions, for each one the prototype was given.
0. Write a function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output. The expected number of letters to print is given in parameter and we return the actual number printed.

Create a function that creates a file with 600 permissions if it does not exist and fill it with a given string.
Write a function that appends a text at the end of an already existing file.
Write a program that copies the content of a file to another file. Error messages are required and format is given.
Write a program that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file.
